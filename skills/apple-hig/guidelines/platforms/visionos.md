# visionOS (Apple Vision Pro)

> 🔢 **exact-spec / version-dependent.** Per-eye resolution is a teardown figure, not an Apple
> spec. Re-verify on Apple.

## Design tenets

**Spatial, immersive, comfortable.** Respect the person's space and body. Content lives in
**Windows**, **Volumes**, and **Spaces**; chrome uses **glass material** and **ornaments**.
Prioritize comfort — minimize fatigue and motion discomfort.

## Input model

- **Eyes + hands (indirect, preferred):** look to target, **pinch** to select; reduces arm
  fatigue. **Direct touch** for near objects. **Hover/look highlight** as feedback.
- **Minimum hit target 60 pt** (eye-tracking imprecision) — larger than the 44 pt touch floor;
  keep ≥ ~4 pt spacing/padding between targets. Place primary controls within comfortable gaze
  range. See [[accessibility]].

## Spatial containers

- **Windows** — resizable 2D surfaces (SwiftUI), default ~**1280 × 720 pt**.
- **Volumes** — bounded 3D content (RealityKit) you can walk around.
- **Spaces** — Shared Space (apps coexist) vs a **Full Space** (immersive, your app only).
- **Ornaments** — controls anchored just outside a window's edge (e.g. a bottom toolbar/tab bar).

## Materials & depth

- Use the system **glass** window material; let real surroundings show through. Content is opaque
  for legibility; chrome is glass. See [[materials]], [[liquid-glass]].
- Use depth and parallax meaningfully; keep text crisp and frontal.

## Motion & comfort (critical)

- **Avoid moving the camera/viewpoint** and large field-of-view motion — it causes motion
  sickness. Keep a **stationary frame of reference** in immersive content; animate objects, not
  the world. Damp, gentle motion. Honor **Reduce Motion**. See [[motion]].

## Resolution

- Apple publishes "**23 million pixels**" total. A teardown estimate is ~**3660 × 3200 px per
  eye** (iFixit/UploadVR) — Apple does **not** publish a per-eye number. Don't design to pixels;
  design in **points** and at comfortable angular sizes.

## Conventions

- Hover effects on look; clear focus feedback. Comfortable reading distance and size.
- Don't crowd the field of view; leave breathing room. Respect passthrough and the user's room.
