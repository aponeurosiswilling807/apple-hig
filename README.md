# apple-hig

A Claude Code plugin that makes Claude design and review user interfaces according to Apple's Human
Interface Guidelines (HIG), automatically choosing the correct platform scope — iOS, iPadOS, macOS,
watchOS, tvOS, or visionOS — for whatever is being built.

![Before and after apple-hig: a real desktop app (EARS Bridge). The "before" has dim low-contrast labels, a cramped layout, an alarming raw error, and empty unreadable meters. The "after", redesigned to Apple's macOS HIG, has semantic colors at 4.5:1+ contrast, a clear grouped hierarchy, a calm plain-language status banner, readable labeled level meters, and an accent capsule action.](docs/before-after.gif?v=2)

## About

`apple-hig` gives Claude a complete, on-disk copy of Apple's design guidance, organized the way Apple
organizes the HIG (Foundations, Patterns, Components, Inputs, Technologies), plus per-platform device
specs and a consolidated design-token file. Because the reference ships with the plugin, Claude never
has to fetch Apple at runtime; a router skill loads only the few files relevant to the current task.

It is meant for anyone building Apple-platform UI — in SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit, or a cross-platform
stack — who wants the output to follow the HIG by default instead of as an afterthought. When you ask
for a screen, a component, or a review, the skill activates on its own, pulls the right rules and exact
values, and applies them. For non-Apple targets (web, Android) it keeps Apple's principles and tokens
but defers to the host platform's conventions rather than imposing iOS chrome.

The reference reflects the current design language, **Liquid Glass** (the "26" generation), refined at
WWDC 2026 into the **iOS/iPadOS/macOS 27 ("Golden Gate")** generation. Its exact values — the type
ramp, the system color palette and its dark-mode variants, device sizes, hit-target and contrast
minimums — were verified against Apple's live HIG. Every file stores a canonical `source_url` and a
"verify on Apple" note, because these specs move with each release.

## Licensing and assets (read this first)

This plugin contains **no Apple binary assets**. It references Apple's fonts, SF Symbols, and design
templates by name and links to Apple's official downloads — it never bundles or redistributes them.

- **SF fonts** (SF Pro, SF Compact, SF Mono, New York, and the non-Latin SF families) are licensed
  *solely* for creating mock-ups of UI for software running on Apple's iOS, iPadOS, macOS, or tvOS.
  They may not be redistributed, embedded, or used to mock up non-Apple-OS interfaces. SF Compact is
  watchOS-only.
- **SF Symbols** are system-provided images. They may **not** be used in app icons, logos, or any other
  trademarked use — and may not be redistributed.
- **Apple Design Resources / templates** are licensed for Apple-platform UI mock-ups only.

When building for **web or Android**, do not ship SF fonts; use the system font stack
(`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, …`) or a freely licensed family such as Inter.

Full details and the official download URLs are in
[`skills/apple-hig/guidelines/licensing-and-assets.md`](skills/apple-hig/guidelines/licensing-and-assets.md).
The reference text (numbers, semantic names, links) is factual and freely usable; Apple's binary assets
remain Apple's property and are not included here.

## Design guidelines at a glance

The rules and values the plugin applies. The full, sourced detail is under
[`skills/apple-hig/guidelines/`](skills/apple-hig/guidelines/).

**Principles.** Establish a clear **Hierarchy** (controls elevate the content beneath them), **Harmony**
(match the concentric design of the hardware — nested corner radii share a center), and **Consistency**
(adopt platform conventions; adapt continuously across sizes). The classic Clarity, Deference, Depth
still underlie the system. Defer to content; prefer system components; design light and dark together.

**Liquid Glass.** The navigation layer (bars, sidebars, controls, sheets) floats above the content in a
dynamic glass material with two variants, *regular* and *clear*; the content layer stays opaque. Honor
Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast. The "27"/Golden Gate refinement adds a user transparency
slider, stronger contrast, and standardized window borders.

**Color.** Use **semantic** colors (`label`, `systemBackground`, accent/tint), never hardcoded hex, so
they adapt to appearance, contrast, and wide gamut. The system palette has 12 tints including the added
**Mint** (`#00C7BE`/`#63E6E2`) and **Cyan** (`#32ADE6`/`#64D2FF`); systemTeal is `#30B0C7`/`#40CBE0`.
Every color has a light and a dark value.

**Typography.** System fonts are SF Pro / SF Compact (watchOS) / New York; support **Dynamic Type**
(use text styles, not fixed sizes). iOS "Large" ramp: Large Title 34/41, Title 1 28/34, Headline & Body
17/22, Subhead 15/20, Caption 2 11/13 (size/leading pt). macOS does not support Dynamic Type.

**Layout and targets.** Work in points; respect safe areas (notch/Dynamic Island, Home indicator,
overscan); use an 8 pt spacing rhythm and size classes. Minimum hit target **44×44 pt** (visionOS
**60×60**); Apple's control-size table lists 44 as the default with 28×28 as the floor (macOS 28/20,
tvOS 66/56).

**Accessibility.** Contrast **4.5:1** body, **3:1** large (≥18 pt / bold); never convey meaning by color
alone; VoiceOver labels on every control, including icon-only ones; provide a **Reduce Motion**
alternative for any animation; support the full Dynamic Type range.

**Per-platform navigation.** iOS — tab bar (2–5, a floating Liquid Glass capsule on 26) plus a
navigation stack. iPadOS / macOS — sidebar + split view + toolbar; macOS has the menu bar. watchOS —
Digital Crown and complications. tvOS — the focus engine and Top Shelf. visionOS — windows, volumes,
spaces, and ornaments, with eyes-and-hands input.

## What you get

- **Auto-activating skill** (`apple-hig`) — a router that triggers on any UI/design/review task for an
  Apple platform (or any product that should follow the HIG) and loads only the relevant guideline
  files. You do not need to name it.
- **`design-reviewer` subagent** — audits UI code (SwiftUI/UIKit/AppKit, React/React Native, Flutter,
  HTML/CSS) and reports violations with the rule, the Apple `source_url`, the location, and a concrete
  fix. Catches sub-44 pt targets, hardcoded/non-semantic colors, missing dark-mode variants, off-grid
  spacing, low contrast, non-standard radii, motion that ignores Reduce Motion, and more.
- **Commands**
  - `/hig-review [path]` — run the design-reviewer on the current file/selection or a path.
  - `/hig-scaffold <platform> <component/screen> [stack]` — generate a HIG-compliant component/screen.
  - `/hig-tokens <css|tailwind|json|swiftui|react-native>` — emit the design tokens (colors, type ramp,
    spacing, radii, control sizes) in the requested format.
- **Optional non-blocking hook** — a gentle reminder after edits to consider `/hig-review`. Delete
  `hooks/hooks.json` if you don't want it.

## Coverage

The reference mirrors Apple's HIG taxonomy: 20 foundations, 6 platforms, 63 components, 27 patterns, 13
inputs, and 29 technologies, plus a consolidated design-token file — every topic Apple documents.

## Install

`apple-hig@apple-hig` is `plugin-name@marketplace-name`. Install it either way:

**In a Claude Code session** (type these as slash commands):

```text
/plugin marketplace add elevatormusic/apple-hig
/plugin install apple-hig@apple-hig
```

**From a terminal** (the `claude` CLI — no interactive session needed):

```text
claude plugin marketplace add elevatormusic/apple-hig
claude plugin install apple-hig@apple-hig
```

The first command adds this repo as a marketplace; the second installs the plugin (user scope by
default; add `--scope project` to install it for a single repo). Restart or start a new Claude Code
session for the plugin to load.

Verify and manage it:

```text
claude plugin list                       # confirm apple-hig is installed and enabled
claude plugin details apple-hig          # show the skill, commands, agent, and token cost
claude plugin update apple-hig           # pull a newer version after the repo is updated
claude plugin uninstall apple-hig        # remove it
claude plugin marketplace remove apple-hig
```

## What gets installed

`claude plugin details apple-hig` reports the component inventory and its projected token cost:

```text
Apple HIG (apple-hig) 1.0.0
Component inventory
  Skills (4)  apple-hig, hig-review, hig-scaffold, hig-tokens
  Agents (1)  design-reviewer
  Hooks  (1)  PostToolUse  (harness-only — no model context cost)
  MCP servers (0) · LSP servers (0)

Projected token cost
  Always-on: ~434 tok added to every session
  component        always-on  on-invoke
  apple-hig             ~180      ~2.5k
  design-reviewer       ~120      ~1.6k
  hig-review             ~50       ~390
  hig-scaffold           ~50       ~540
  hig-tokens             ~40      ~1.2k
```

Only the small always-on descriptions sit in every session; the full guideline files load on demand
when a skill or the reviewer actually fires, and the router pulls just the handful of files relevant
to the task. (Token counts are estimates.)

## Usage

Just work on an Apple-platform UI and the skill activates on its own — no need to name it. It also
works for any app or website you want to feel Apple-clean. Some prompts that trigger it:

**Build / scaffold**
- "Design an iPhone **settings screen** in SwiftUI, HIG-compliant."
- "Build a **visionOS** detail view with an ornament toolbar."
- "Lay out a **macOS** preferences window with a sidebar and proper control sizes."
- "Make this React form follow Apple's spacing, type ramp, and dark mode."

**Review / fix**
- "**Review** `SettingsView.swift` for HIG compliance."
- "Audit this component's **touch targets, contrast, and dark-mode** coverage."
- "Why does this screen feel off vs. a native iOS app? Fix it."

**Redesign / improve**
- "**Redesign** this screen to Apple's macOS HIG." (paste your UI — like the EARS Bridge example above)
- "Tidy the hierarchy and error states on this window."

**Tokens**
- "Give me the HIG **color + type tokens** as Tailwind." / "…as a SwiftUI `Color` extension."

Or drive the commands directly:

```text
/hig-scaffold ios settings screen swiftui
/hig-review Sources/SettingsView.swift
/hig-tokens css
/hig-tokens swiftui
```

### See it, don't just read it (optional)

Install the **Playwright MCP** alongside apple-hig and the reviewer can *render* your UI and verify it
visually — real contrast, spacing, target sizes, and dark mode — not just read the code:

```text
/plugin install playwright@claude-plugins-official
```

Then a prompt like "review this screen and **render it to check** contrast and dark mode" will screenshot
the running UI and report what it sees. (This is exactly how the before/after above was produced.)

## Use it in other AI coding tools

The full plugin experience — the auto-activating skill, the `design-reviewer` subagent, and the
`/hig-*` commands — is specific to Claude Code. Every other tool can still use the **guidelines as
project rules**, generated from a single canonical ruleset.

### One command

Run this in your project. It writes the correct rules file for your tool (right path, right
frontmatter), derived from [`integrations/apple-hig.md`](integrations/apple-hig.md):

```text
npx github:elevatormusic/apple-hig --tool cursor
npx github:elevatormusic/apple-hig --tool agents,copilot,windsurf   # several at once
npx github:elevatormusic/apple-hig --tool all --vendor             # all tools + copy the guideline files into ./apple-hig/
```

No Node? Clone the repo and run `node scripts/install-rules.mjs --tool <slug>` (`--list` shows every
tool). `--vendor` copies the full 161-file guideline set into your project so the assistant can read
exact, sourced specs; otherwise the rules file carries the core rules and key tokens inline.

Tool slugs: `agents` · `cursor` · `windsurf` · `copilot` · `cline` · `roo` · `aider` · `gemini` ·
`amazonq` · `continue` · `junie` · `claude`.

### Or add the rules file by hand

Copy `integrations/apple-hig.md` to the path your tool reads (prepend the frontmatter where noted):

| Tool | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **AGENTS.md standard** — OpenAI Codex, Zed, Gemini CLI, Aider*, Amp, goose, opencode, Jules, Factory, Warp, Kilo Code, RooCode, JetBrains Junie, GitHub Copilot coding agent, … | `AGENTS.md` (repo root) | Plain markdown, auto-discovered. One file covers many tools. |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/rules/apple-hig.mdc` | Frontmatter: `description`, `globs:`, `alwaysApply: true` |
| **Windsurf** | `.windsurf/rules/apple-hig.md` | Frontmatter: `trigger: always_on` |
| **GitHub Copilot** | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Repo-wide. Or path-scope via `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (`applyTo`) |
| **Cline** | `.clinerules/apple-hig.md` | Plain markdown |
| **Roo Code** | `.roo/rules/apple-hig.md` | Plain markdown |
| **Aider** | `CONVENTIONS.md` | Not auto-loaded: add `read: CONVENTIONS.md` to `.aider.conf.yml` (or `aider --read CONVENTIONS.md`) |
| **Gemini CLI** | `GEMINI.md` | Or point `contextFileName` at `AGENTS.md` in `.gemini/settings.json` |
| **Amazon Q Developer** | `.amazonq/rules/apple-hig.md` | Plain markdown |
| **Continue** | `.continue/rules/apple-hig.md` | Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `alwaysApply: true` |
| **JetBrains Junie / AI Assistant** | `.junie/guidelines.md` / `.aiassistant/rules/apple-hig.md` | Plain markdown |
| **Claude Code** | `CLAUDE.md` | Fallback only — prefer the native plugin above |

`* Aider` reads `AGENTS.md` only with the same `read:` opt-in. **AGENTS.md** is the closest cross-tool
standard — one file covers most of the list. These conventions move fast; check your tool's docs and
<https://agents.md> if a path has changed.

## How it works

`skills/apple-hig/SKILL.md` is a router, not the content. On each task it loads
`guidelines/universal.md`, detects the platform, then loads only the specific component/foundation/
pattern files needed (there is a keyword-to-file routing table in the skill). Exact numbers come from
`references/design-tokens.md`. Nothing is fetched from Apple at runtime.

## Develop and validate locally

Validate the manifests and load the plugin from disk without installing:

```text
claude plugin validate ./apple-hig --strict
claude --plugin-dir /absolute/path/to/apple-hig
```

Then confirm the `apple-hig` skill activates on a UI request, the commands appear, and the
`design-reviewer` agent is available. Update later by pushing changes and bumping `version` in both
manifests; users run `/plugin marketplace update apple-hig`.
