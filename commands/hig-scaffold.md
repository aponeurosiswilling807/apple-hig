Generate a HIG-compliant component or screen.

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS
Parse it for: target **platform** (ios | ipados | macos | watchos | tvos | visionos | web), the
**component/screen** to build, and the **stack** (default to SwiftUI for Apple platforms; ask if a
web/cross-platform target is ambiguous).

Steps:

1. **Engage the `apple-hig` skill** to load the right guidelines. The skill resolves the bundled file
   paths and its routing table maps the platform + component to the specific
   `foundations/`, `platforms/`, `components/`, and `patterns/` files to read (and
   `references/design-tokens.md` for exact values). Load only what's relevant — don't read the whole
   guidelines folder.
2. **Generate code** in the chosen stack that is compliant by construction:
   - Prefer **system components**; use **semantic colors** (never hardcoded hex) and **text styles**
     (Dynamic Type), not fixed sizes.
   - Meet **44×44 pt** (60 pt visionOS) targets; on-grid spacing (4/8 pt rhythm); concentric/capsule
     radii; safe areas; leading/trailing (RTL-safe).
   - Provide **light + dark** appearances; **VoiceOver labels** on icon-only controls; a **Reduce
     Motion** alternative for any animation.
   - Use the platform's current design language (Liquid Glass chrome on the 26/27 generation; do not
     put glass on the content layer).
   - For **web/Android** targets: keep Apple principles + tokens but use the host platform's
     conventions; don't impose iOS chrome.
3. **Annotate** the generated code with brief comments noting which HIG rule each choice satisfies.
4. **Summarize** what you built and list any decisions to confirm (tint color, number of tabs, etc.).
   Offer to run `/hig-review` on the result.
